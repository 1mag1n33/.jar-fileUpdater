# 1mag1n33--.jar-fileUpdater

This is a simple project i made to keep my friends from asking what mods are on the server

# Getting Started

Simpley just put the .exe in your perferd directorys and double click them, they will load config.yaml in the client.yaml there will be url and a mod folder specifiy where u would like for your mods to be installed. For the http_server in the yaml there will be a port specifiy the port where u would want your http_server to be launched. For the server in the yaml there will be a "path_to_jars" u want to put the path to the mods folder in the server directory. Finally for the run.bat u want to replace "path" with the fodler location of the server.exe then u want to replace "your server jar file" with your minecraft servers jar file when your done with all of that you are ready to go.
